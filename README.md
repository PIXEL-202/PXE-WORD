# x-word
The word x uses 
many modern algorithms
to create the best
word list and after 
completing the tool,
it checks the file
and deletes similar 
words - produces 
about one and a half
million passwords.
Enter the personâ€™s
full name and date of
birth and browse a 
million passwords. The 
passes of the tool 
are peaceful reasons for
testing the password. 
Responsible here for 
any bad use of the tool
